   abstract = {Motivation: The sequence alignment/map (SAM) and the binary alignment/map (BAM) formats have become the standard method of representation of nucleotide sequence alignments for next-generation sequencing data. SAM/BAM files usually contain information from tens to hundreds of millions of reads. Often, the sequencing technology, protocol and/or the selected mapping algorithm introduce some unwanted biases in these data. The systematic detection of such biases is a non-trivial task that is crucial to drive appropriate downstream analyses.Results: We have developed Qualimap, a Java application that supports user-friendly quality control of mapping data, by considering sequence features and their genomic properties. Qualimap takes sequence alignment data and provides graphical and statistical analyses for the evaluation of data. Such quality-control data are vital for highlighting problems in the sequencing and/or mapping processes, which must be addressed prior to further analyses. © The Author 2012.

Efficient adapter trimming algorithms are also needed to process the growing amount of data generated per sequencing run. Findings: We introduce AdapterRemoval v2, a major revision of AdapterRemoval v1, which introduces (i) striking improvements in throughput, through the use of single instruction, multiple data (SIMD; SSE1 and SSE2) instructions and multi-threading support, (ii) the ability to handle datasets containing reads or read-pairs with different adapters or adapter pairs, (iii) simultaneous demultiplexing and adapter trimming, (iv) the ability to reconstruct adapter sequences from paired-end reads for poorly documented data sets, and (v) native gzip and bzip2 support. Conclusions: We show that AdapterRemoval v2 compares favorably with existing tools, while offering superior throughput to most alternatives examined here, both for single and multi-threaded operations.},

   abstract = {Background: BRAKER is a suite of automatic pipelines, BRAKER1 and BRAKER2, for the accurate annotation of protein-coding genes in eukaryotic genomes. Each pipeline trains statistical models of protein-coding genes based on provided evidence and, then predicts protein-coding genes in genomic sequences using both the extrinsic evidence and statistical models. For training and prediction, BRAKER1 and BRAKER2 incorporate complementary extrinsic evidence: BRAKER1 uses only RNA-seq data while BRAKER2 uses only a database of cross-species proteins. The BRAKER suite has so far not been able to reliably exceed the accuracy of BRAKER1 and BRAKER2 when incorporating both types of evidence simultaneously. Currently, for a novel genome project where both RNA-seq and protein data are available, the best option is to run both pipelines independently, and to pick one, likely better output. Therefore, one or another type of the extrinsic evidence would remain unexploited. Results: We present TSEBRA, a software that selects gene predictions (transcripts) from the sets generated by BRAKER1 and BRAKER2. TSEBRA uses a set of rules to compare scores of overlapping transcripts based on their support by RNA-seq and homologous protein evidence. We show in computational experiments on genomes of 11 species that TSEBRA achieves higher accuracy than either BRAKER1 or BRAKER2 running alone and that TSEBRA compares favorably with the combiner tool EVidenceModeler. Conclusion: TSEBRA is an easy-to-use and fast software tool. It can be used in concert with the BRAKER pipeline to generate a gene prediction set supported by both RNA-seq and homologous protein evidence.},

   abstract = {Background: In order to improve gene prediction, extrinsic evidence on the gene structure can be collected from various sources of information such as genome-genome comparisons and EST and protein alignments. However, such evidence is often incomplete and usually uncertain. The extrinsic evidence is usually not sufficient to recover the complete gene structure of all genes completely and the available evidence is often unreliable. Therefore extrinsic evidence is most valuable when it is balanced with sequence-intrinsic evidence. Results: We present a fairly general method for integration of external information. Our method is based on the evaluation of hints to potentially protein-coding regions by means of a Generalized Hidden Morkov Model (GHMM) that takes both intrinsic and extrinsic information into account. We used this method to extend the ab initio gene prediction program AUGUSTUS to a versatile tool that we call AUGUSTUS+. In this study, we focus on hints derived from matches to an EST or protein database, but our approach can be used to include arbitrary user-defined hints. Our method is only moderately effected by the length of a database match. Further, it exploits the information that can be derived from the absence of such matches. As a special case, AUGUSTUS+ can predict genes under user-defined constraints, e.g. if the positions of certain exons are known. With hints from EST and protein databases, our new approach was able to predict 89% of the exons in human chromosome 22 correctly. Conclusion: Sensitive probabilistic modeling of extrinsic evidence such as sequence database matches can increase gene prediction accuracy. When a match of a sequence interval to an EST or protein sequence is used it should be treated as compound information rather than as information about individual positions. © 2006 Stanke et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Motivation: Computational annotation of protein coding genes in genomic DNA is a widely used and essential tool for analyzing newly sequenced genomes. However, current methods suffer from inaccuracy and do poorly with certain types of genes. Including additional sources of evidence of the existence and structure of genes can improve the quality of gene predictions. For many eukaryotic genomes, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are available as evidence for genes. Related genomes that have been sequenced, annotated, and aligned to the target genome provide evidence of existence and structure of genes. Results: We incorporate several different evidence sources into the gene finder AUGUSTUS. The sources of evidence are gene and transcript annotations from related species syntenically mapped to the target genome using TRANSMAP, evolutionary conservation of DNA, mRNA and ESTs of the target species, and retroposed genes. The predictions include alternative splice variants where evidence supports it. Using only ESTs we were able to correctly predict at least one splice form exactly correct in 57% of human genes. Also using evidence from other species and human mRNAs, this number rises to 77%. Syntenic mapping is well-suited to annotate genomes closely related to genomes that are already annotated or for which extensive transcript evidence is available. Native cDNA evidence is most helpful when the alignments are used as compound information rather than independent positionwise information. © 2008 The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Gene prediction has remained an active area of bioinformatics research for a long time. Still, gene prediction in large eukaryotic genomes presents a challenge that must be addressed by new algorithms. The amount and significance of the evidence available from transcriptomes and proteomes vary across genomes, between genes, and even along a single gene. User-friendly and accurate annotation pipelines that can cope with such data heterogeneity are needed. The previously developed annotation pipelines BRAKER1 and BRAKER2 use RNA-seq or protein data, respectively, but not both. A further significant performance improvement integrating all three data types was made by the recently released GeneMark-ETP. We here present the BRAKER3 pipeline that builds on GeneMark-ETP and AUGUSTUS, and further improves accuracy using the TSEBRA combiner. BRAKER3 annotates protein-coding genes in eukaryotic genomes using both short-read RNA-seq and a large protein database, along with statistical models learned iteratively and specifically for the target genome. We benchmarked the new pipeline on genomes of 11 species under an assumed level of relatedness of the target species proteome to available proteomes. BRAKER3 outperforms BRAKER1 and BRAKER2. The average transcript-level F1-score is increased by about 20 percentage points on average, whereas the difference is most pronounced for species with large and complex genomes. BRAKER3 also outperforms other existing tools, MAKER2, Funannotate, and FINDER. The code of BRAKER3 is available on GitHub and as a ready-to-run Docker container for execution with Docker or Singularity. Overall, BRAKER3 is an accurate, easy-to-use tool for eukaryotic genome annotation.},

Even though many spliced alignment programs have been developed, recent rapid progress in DNA sequencing technologies demands further improvements in software tools. Benchmarking algorithms under various conditions is an indispensable task for the development of better software; however, there is a dire lack of appropriate datasets usable for benchmarking spliced alignment programs. In this study, we have constructed two types of datasets: simulated sequence datasets and actual cross-species datasets. The datasets are designed to correspond to various real situations, i.e. divergent eukaryotic species, different types of reference sequences, and the wide divergence between query and target sequences. In addition, we have developed an extended version of our program Spaln, which incorporates two additional features to the scoring scheme of the original version, and examined this extended version, Spaln2, together with the original Spaln and other representative aligners based on our benchmark datasets. Although the effects of the modifications are not individually striking, Spaln2 is consistently most accurate and reasonably fast in most practical cases, especially for plants and fungi and for increasingly divergent pairs of target and query sequences. © 2012 The Author(s).},

We devised a multi-phase heuristic algorithm and implemented it in the development of the stand-alone computer program Spaln (space-efficient spliced alignment). Spaln is reasonably fast and space efficient; it requires < 1 Gb of memory to map and align > 120 000 Unigene sequences onto the unmasked whole human genome with a conventional computer, finishing the job in < 6 h. With artificially introduced noise of various levels, Spaln significantly outperforms other leading alignment programs currently available with respect to the accuracy of mapped exon-intron structures.

GeneMark-ETP first identifies genomic loci where extrinsic data is sufficient for making gene predictions with ‘high confidence’. The genes situated in the genomic space between the high confidence genes are predicted in the next stage. The set of high confidence genes serves as an initial training set for the statistical model. Further on, the model parameters are iteratively updated in the rounds of gene prediction and parameter re-estimation. Upon reaching convergence, GeneMark-ETP makes the final predictions and delivers the whole complement of predicted genes. GeneMark-ETP outperformed gene finders using a single type of extrinsic evidence. Comparisons with gene finders utilizing both transcript- and protein-derived extrinsic evidence, MAKER2, and TSEBRA, demonstrated that GeneMark-ETP delivered state-of-the-art gene prediction accuracy with the margin of outperforming existing approaches increasing in its applications to larger and more complex eukaryotic genomes.},

AUGUSTUS is a gene finder that usually requires supervised training and uses information from RNA-Seq reads in the prediction step. Complementary strengths of GeneMark-ET and AUGUSTUS provided motivation for designing a new combined tool for automatic gene prediction. Results: We present BRAKER1, a pipeline for unsupervised RNA-Seq-based genome annotation that combines the advantages of GeneMark-ET and AUGUSTUS. As input, BRAKER1 requires a genome assembly file and a file in bam-format with spliced alignments of RNA-Seq reads to the genome. First, GeneMark-ET performs iterative training and generates initial gene structures. Second, AUGUSTUS uses predicted genes for training and then integrates RNA-Seq read information into final gene predictions. In our experiments, we observed that BRAKER1 was more accurate than MAKER2 when it is using RNA-Seq as sole source for training and prediction. BRAKER1 does not require pre-trained parameters or a separate expert-prepared training step.},

   abstract = {Habitat loss and population fragmentation pose severe threats to biodiversity and the survival of many species. Population isolation and the decline in effective population size lead to increased genetic drift and inbreeding. In turn, this reduces neutral diversity, and it also affects the genetic load of deleterious mutations. Here, we analyse the effect of such genomic erosion by designing a spatially explicit, individual based model in SLiM, simulating the effects of the recorded habitat loss in Mauritius over the past ~ 250 years. We show that the loss of neutral diversity (genome-wide heterozygosity) was barely noticeable during the first 100 years of habitat loss. Changes to the genetic load took even more time to register, and they only became apparent circa 200 years after the start of habitat decline. Although a considerable number of deleterious mutations were lost by drift, others increased in frequency. The masked load was thus converted into a realised load, which compromised individual fitness and population viability after much of the native habitat had been lost. Importantly, genomic erosion continued after the metapopulation had stabilised at low numbers. Our study shows that historic habitat loss can pose a sustained threat to populations also in future generations, even without further habitat loss. The UN’s Decade on Ecosystem Restoration needs to lead to transformative change to save species from future extinction, and this requires the urgent restoration of natural habitats.},

HALDANE (1937) and MULLER (1950) had earlier shown that this load is largely independent of the harmfulness of the mutant. As long as the selective disadvantage of the mutant is of a larger order of magnitude than the mutation rate and the heterozygote fitness is not out of the range of that of the homozygotes, the load (measured in terms of fitness) is equal to the mutation rate for a recessive mutant and approximately twice the mutation rate for a dominant mutant. A detailed calculation of the value for various degrees of dominance has been given by KIMURA (1961). In all these studies it has been assumed that the population is so large and the conditions so stable that the frequency of a mutant gene is exactly determined by the mutation rates, dominance, and selection coefficients, with no random fluctuation. However, actual populations are finite and also there are departures from equilibrium conditions because of variations in the various determining factors. Our purpose is to investigate the effect of random drift caused by a finite population number. It would be expected that the load would increase in a small population because the gene frequencies would drift away from the equilibrium values. This was confirmed by our mathematical investigations, but two somewhat unexpected results emerged. One is that, for a given population size, a mildly deleterious mutant may create a considerably larger load than a more deleterious one. The second is that, under some circumstances, a finite population may have a smaller load than an infinite one.},

The neutrality index (NI = DsPn/DnPs), the odds ratio (OR) of the MK table, measures the direction and degree of departure from neutral evolution. The mean of NI values across genes is often taken to summarize patterns of selection in a species. Here, we show that this leads to statistical bias in both simulated and real data to the extent that species, which show a pattern of adaptive evolution, can apparently be subject to weak purifying selection and vice versa. We show that this bias can be removed by using a variant of the Cochran - Mantel-Haenszel procedure for estimating a weighted average OR. We also show that several point estimators of NI are statistically biased even when cutoff values are employed. We therefore suggest that a new statistic be used to study patterns of selection when data are sparse, the direction of selection: DoS = Dn/(Dn + Ds) - Pn/(Pn + Ps). © 2010 The Author.},

   abstract = {The subdivision of a species into local populations causes its response to selection to change, even if selection is uniform across space. Population structure increases the frequency of homozygotes and therefore makes selection on homozygous effects more effective. However, population subdivision can increase the probability of competition among relatives, which may reduce the efficacy of selection. As a result, the response to selection can be either increased or decreased in a subdivided population relative to an undivided one, depending on the dominance coefficient F ST and whether selection is hard or soft. Realistic levels of population structure tend to reduce the mean frequency of deleterious alleles. The mutation load tends to be decreased in a subdivided population for recessive alleles, as does the expected inbreeding depression. The magnitude of the effects of population subdivision tends to be greatest in species with hard selection rather than soft selection. Population structure can play an important role in determining the mean fitness of populations at equilibrium between mutation and selection.},

By analyzing 66 individual whole genomes of Montezuma Quail (Cyrtonyx montezumae) from multiple populations, we illustrate how genetic load is dynamic over evolutionary time. We show that Montezuma Quail are evolving like a ring species, where the terminal extant populations from Arizona and Texas have been separated for ~16,500 years. The Texas populations have remained small but stable since the separation, whereas the Arizona population is much larger today but has been contracting for thousands of years. Most deleterious mutations across the genome are young and segregating privately in each population and a greater number of deleterious alleles are present in the larger population. Our data indicate that ancestral load is purged during strong bottlenecks, but the reduced efficiency of selection in small populations means that segregating deleterious mutations are more likely to rise in frequency over time. Forward-time simulations indicate that severe population declines in historically large populations is more detrimental to individual fitness, whereas long-term small populations are more at risk for reduced adaptive potential and population-level fitness. Our study highlights the intimate connections among evolutionary history, historical demography, genetic load, and evolutionary potential in wild populations.},

   abstract = {The accelerating pace of genome sequencing throughout the tree of life is driving the need for improved unsupervised annotation of genome components such as transposable elements (TEs). Because the types and sequences of TEs are highly variable across species, automated TE discovery and annotation are challenging and time-consuming tasks. A critical first step is the de novo identification and accurate compilation of sequence models representing all of the unique TE families dispersed in the genome. Here we introduce RepeatModeler2, a pipeline that greatly facilitates this process. This program brings substantial improvements over the original version of RepeatModeler, one of the most widely used tools for TE discovery. In particular, this version incorporates a module for structural discovery of complete long terminal repeat (LTR) retroelements, which are widespread in eukaryotic genomes but recalcitrant to automated identification because of their size and sequence complexity. We benchmarked RepeatModeler2 on three model species with diverse TE landscapes and high-quality, manually curated TE libraries: Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), Danio rerio (zebrafish), and Oryza sativa (rice). In these three species, RepeatModeler2 identified approximately 3 times more consensus sequences matching with >95% sequence identity and sequence coverage to the manually curated sequences than the original RepeatModeler. As expected, the greatest improvement is
for LTR retroelements. Thus, RepeatModeler2 represents a valuable addition to the genome annotation toolkit that will enhance the identification and study of TEs in eukaryotic genome sequences.

   abstract = {We describe a new computer program, SnpEff, for rapidly categorizing the effects of variants in genome sequences. Once a genome is sequenced, SnpEff annotates variants based on their genomic locations and predicts coding effects. Annotated genomic locations include intronic, untranslated region, upstream, downstream, splice site, or intergenic regions. Coding effects such as synonymous or non-synonymous amino acid replacement, start codon gains or losses, stop codon gains or losses, or frame shifts can be predicted. Here the use of SnpEff is illustrated by annotating ~356,660 candidate SNPs in ~117 Mb unique sequences, representing a substitution rate of ~1/305 nucleotides, between the Drosophila melanogaster w1118; iso-2; iso-3 strain and the reference y1; cn1 bw1 sp1 strain. We show that ~15,842 SNPs are synonymous and ~4,467 SNPs are non-synonymous (N/S ~0.28). The remaining SNPs are in other categories, such as stop codon gains (38 SNPs), stop codon losses (8 SNPs), and start codon gains (297 SNPs) in the 5'UTR. We found, as expected, that the SNP frequency is proportional to the recombination frequency (i.e., highest in the middle of chromosome arms). We also found that start-gain or stop-lost SNPs in Drosophila melanogaster often result in additions of N-terminal or C-terminal amino acids that are conserved in other Drosophila species. It appears that the 5' and 3'UTRs are reservoirs for genetic variations that changes the termini of proteins during evolution of the Drosophila genus. As genome sequencing is becoming inexpensive and routine, SnpEff enables rapid analyses of whole-genome sequencing data to be performed by an individual laboratory. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.},

Studies on vertebrates highlight how conservation genomics can be an effective tool to identify and manage threatened populations. However, it is unclear how metrics of genomic erosion, commonly applied in conservation genomics, translate to invertebrate species which can have markedly different
population sizes and life history strategies. The Black-veined White butterfly (Aporia crataegi) was extirpated from Britain in the 1920s. Here, we sequenced historical DNA from 17 museum specimens collected between 1854 and 1924 to determine levels of genomic erosion in the species as it
approached extirpation. We compare these results to those from the Common Blue butterfly (Polyommatus icarus) - a species with stable demographic trends in Great Britain. We provide evidence for a bottleneck of British butterflies around the period of post-glacial colonisation of the 42 British Isles. Despite a 4X difference in effective population sizes around the time of post-glacial colonisation, reduction in genome-wide heterozygosity (our metric for genetic diversity) in A. crataegi (17.9%) was comparable to that in P. icarus (14.5%). More symptomatic of A. crataegi’s disappearance were marked increases in size and proportion of runs-of-homozygosity (RoH) and accumulation of putatively mildly and weakly deleterious variants. Our results support the notion that metrics with more direct links to host fitness and function, such as inbreeding and genetic load, may be more informative of population decline and thus more valuable in identifying vulnerable insect populations.},

Here we study the genomic erosion of the Seychelles paradise flycatcher (Terpsiphone corvina), a species that narrowly avoided extinction after having declined to 28 individuals in the 1960s. The species recovered unassisted to over 250 individuals in the 1990s and was downlisted from Critically Endangered to Vulnerable in the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List in 2020. By comparing historical, prebottleneck (130+ years old) and modern genomes, we uncovered a 10-fold loss of genetic diversity. Highly deleterious mutations were partly purged during the bottleneck, but mildly deleterious mutations accumulated. The genome shows signs of historical inbreeding during the bottleneck in the 1960s, but low levels of recent inbreeding after demographic recovery. Computer simulations suggest that the species long-Term small Ne reduced the masked genetic load and made the species more resilient to inbreeding and extinction. However, the reduction in genetic diversity due to the chronically small Ne and the severe bottleneck is likely to have reduced the species adaptive potential to face environmental change, which together with a higher load, compromises its long-Term population viability. Thus, small ancestral Ne offers short-Term bottleneck resilience but hampers long-Term adaptability to environmental shifts. In light of rapid global rates of population decline, our work shows that species can continue to suffer the effect of their decline even after recovery, highlighting the importance of considering genomic erosion and computer modeling in conservation assessments.},

As predicted, we found positive correlations between genome-wide estimates of neutral genetic diversity (π) and inferred levels of adaptive variation and an estimate of inbreeding mutation load, and a negative relationship between neutral diversity and an estimate of drift mutation load. However, these correlations were half as strong for projected future levels of neutral diversity based on contemporary effective population sizes. Broadly, our results confirm that estimates of neutral genetic diversity provide an accurate measure of genetic erosion in populations of a threatened vertebrate. They also provide nuance to the neutral-functional diversity controversy by suggesting that while these correlations exist, anthropogenetic impacts may have weakened these associations in the recent past and into the future.},

However, they either focus only on removing contained duplicate regions, also known as haplotigs, or fail to use all the relevant information and hence make errors. Results: Here we present a novel tool, purge_dups, that uses sequence similarity and read depth to automatically identify and remove both haplotigs and heterozygous overlaps. In comparison with current tools, we demonstrate that purge_dups can reduce heterozygous duplication and increase assembly continuity while maintaining completeness of the primary assembly. Moreover, purge_dups is fully automatic and can easily be integrated into assembly pipelines.},

   abstract = {Routine haplotype-resolved genome assembly from single samples remains an unresolved problem. Here we describe an algorithm that combines PacBio HiFi reads and Hi-C chromatin interaction data to produce a haplotype-resolved assembly without the sequencing of parents. Applied to human and other vertebrate samples, our algorithm consistently outperforms existing single-sample assembly pipelines and generates assemblies of similar quality to the best pedigree-based assemblies.},

   abstract = {The task of eukaryotic genome annotation remains challenging. Only a few genomes could serve as standards of annotation achieved through a tremendous investment of human curation efforts. Still, the correctness of all alternative isoforms, even in the best-Annotated genomes, could be a good subject for further investigation. The new BRAKER2 pipeline generates and integrates external protein support into the iterative process of training and gene prediction by GeneMark-EP+ and AUGUSTUS. BRAKER2 continues the line started by BRAKER1 where self-Training GeneMark-ET and AUGUSTUS made gene predictions supported by transcriptomic data. Among the challenges addressed by the new pipeline was a generation of reliable hints to protein-coding exon boundaries from likely homologous but evolutionarily distant proteins. In comparison with other pipelines for eukaryotic genome annotation, BRAKER2 is fully automatic. It is favorably compared under equal conditions with other pipelines, e.g. MAKER2, in terms of accuracy and performance. Development of BRAKER2 should facilitate solving the task of harmonization of annotation of protein-coding genes in genomes of different eukaryotic species. However, we fully understand that several more innovations are needed in transcriptomic and proteomic technologies as well as in algorithmic development to reach the goal of highly accurate annotation of eukaryotic genomes.},

   abstract = {Haplotype-resolved de novo assembly is the ultimate solution to the study of sequence variations in a genome. However, existing algorithms either collapse heterozygous alleles into one consensus copy or fail to cleanly separate the haplotypes to produce high-quality phased assemblies. Here we describe hifiasm, a de novo assembler that takes advantage of long high-fidelity sequence reads to faithfully represent the haplotype information in a phased assembly graph. Unlike other graph-based assemblers that only aim to maintain the contiguity of one haplotype, hifiasm strives to preserve the contiguity of all haplotypes. This feature enables the development of a graph trio binning algorithm that greatly advances over standard trio binning. On three human and five nonhuman datasets, including California redwood with a ~30-Gb hexaploid genome, we show that hifiasm frequently delivers better assemblies than existing tools and consistently outperforms others on haplotype-resolved assembly.},

   abstract = {Methods for evaluating the quality of genomic and metagenomic data are essential to aid genome assembly procedures and to correctly interpret the results of subsequent analyses. BUSCO estimates the completeness and redundancy of processed genomic data based on universal single-copy orthologs. Here, we present new functionalities and major improvements of the BUSCO software, as well as the renewal and expansion of the underlying data sets in sync with the OrthoDB v10 release. Among the major novelties, BUSCO now enables phylogenetic placement of the input sequence to automatically select the most appropriate BUSCO data set for the assessment, allowing the analysis of metagenome-Assembled genomes of unknown origin. A newly introduced genome workflow increases the efficiency and runtimes especially on large eukaryotic genomes. BUSCO is the only tool capable of assessing both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species, and can be applied to various data types, from genome assemblies and metagenomic bins, to transcriptomes and gene sets.},
